            The Mobile App/Website will automatically receive and collect
            certain anonymous information in standard usage logs through our Web
            server, including computer-identification information obtained from
            “cookies” sent to your browser from a web server or other means.
            “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files
            that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s
            hard drive.

            to help ensure the security and authenticity of registered users,

            When you register for the Services, the Mobile App/Website requires
            a Login ID and a password from you for your privacy and security.
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of this ID
            and password and not provide these to any third party. We recommend
            that you change your password periodically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your password must conform to standards and, as a security feature
            the Website may automatically reject weak passwords. We shall not be
            responsible if someone else accesses your account through Login ID

          <p>
            While accessing your linked accounts online, the Mobile App/Website
            uses a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and
            authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of
            your online session, and to protect Mobile App/Website accounts and
            systems from unauthorized access. From the time you submit your
            Login ID and password, these communications between your
            computer/mobile and the Website are encrypted using at least 256-bit
            secure socket layer technology (SSL). This enables client and server
            applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent
            eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. The Mobile App
            /Website also encrypts your password so that your password cannot be
            recovered, even by us.
